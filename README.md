### What I learned

Learnt more about semantics in my table.

```html
<div class="table" role="table">
        <div class="row" role="row">
          <div role="cell" class="col ff-primary fs-400 text-neutral-600 fw-normal">Calories</div>
          <div role="cell" class="col ff-primary fs-400 fw-semibold text-primary-800"> 277kcal</div>
        </div>
```



### Continued development

I think I need to move on to multipage layouts and maybe a little bit more advnaced designs.
